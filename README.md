In this notebook, we will become familiar with:
* Tensor initialization
* Main attributes of tensors: dtype, device, requires_grad
* Tensor operations
* Derivatives and gradients
* Simple linear regression
* Train and Fit 

### Introduction to PyTorch Part 2

In this notebook we will solve the digit classification task with 3 different models of progressively increasing complexity:

* Linear classifier (logistic regression)
* Multilayer perceptron (non-linear fully connected network)
* Convolutional neural network
